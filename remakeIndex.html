<!-- A little information about the webpage and the band-->
<br/>
<div style="width:1000px; margin: auto;">
<p>Welcome to my webpage! This page is all about my favorite band of all time, They Might Be Giants.</p>
<p>This band, founded in 1982 by two friends from college, John Linnell and John Flansburgh (yes they are
    both named John), has been making music for the span of over 4 decades.</p>

     alt="A pretty sick picture of the Johns duo"> ← This is them! Don't they look cool?
</div>
<div style="width:1000px; margin: auto;">
<p>Their music, which can fall into the categories of alternative, new wave, geek rock, and even children's
    music, is quite quirky, containing various somewhat random lyrics and diverse instrumentation.</p>
<p>Due to this, their music is very versatile and can appeal to a wide range of audiences. I believe that
    there's at least one song by the band that you've at least heard once *cough cough* Mickey Mouse Clubhouse
    *cough cough*, but their band is so much more than that. And I am here to give several suggestions to broaden
    your musical selections to be inclusive of TMBG!</p>
