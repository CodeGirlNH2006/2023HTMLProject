<h2><font color="goldenrod">TMBG Beginnings</font></h2>
<p>While the band started with their first albums of <i>They Might Be Giants</i> and <i>Lincoln</i>, the first album that sold really well was <i>Flood</i>. This album is certified platinum, signifying over 1 million copies of the album were sold. This album I recommend as a good one to start out on.</p>
<p>This album has a lot of my personal favorites, being that it was the album that introduced me to the band as a little kid. It contains 19 songs, including one of their most well-known and loved singles, "Birdhouse in Your Soul".</p>
